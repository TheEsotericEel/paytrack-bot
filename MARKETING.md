# PayTrackBot Marketing Strategy

**How to get first 10 paying users (20-30 hours over 8 weeks)**

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Solo freelancers
- Developers, designers, writers, consultants
- Earning $2k-$15k/month
- 1-10 active clients

Title: "I built a Telegram bot to stop forgetting which clients owe me money"

Body:
I'm a freelance developer and lost track of $2,300 in unpaid invoices last year. 

So I built PayTrackBot - dead simple invoice tracker that lives in Telegram:
- Add invoices in 10 seconds
- Get reminders when payments are due
- See exactly who owes you what

Free for up to 3 unpaid invoices. Pro version ($7/month) has unlimited + auto-reminders.

Built it this weekend, would love feedback!
```

**Promo:** First 50 users get lifetime 50% off Pro ($3.50/month)

### Week 2: Product Hunt

**Goal:** 50-100 signups, 5-10 Pro users

1. **Prepare launch**
   - Write compelling tagline: "Never miss a freelance payment again"
   - Create 3-5 screenshots
   - Polish demo video
   - Line up 3-5 friends to upvote/comment

2. **Launch on Tuesday-Thursday** (best days)
   - Post early (12:01 AM PST)
   - Respond to ALL comments
   - Share on Twitter, LinkedIn

3. **Cross-promote**
   - Post in Indie Hackers
   - Share in freelance Slack/Discord groups
   - Email freelancer friends

### Week 3-4: Twitter Thread Strategy

**Goal:** Viral reach, 10+ Pro users

**Thread template:**
```
I forgot $2,300 in unpaid invoices last year.

So I built a Telegram bot to make sure it never happens again.

Here's how freelancers can track every dollar owed: 🧵

1/ The problem: Spreadsheets get forgotten. Email gets buried. 
FreshBooks is $15/month overkill for solo freelancers.

2/ The solution: Track everything in Telegram (where you already are)
- Add invoice in 10 seconds
- Get reminded when payment is due
- Mark paid instantly

3/ I built @PayTrackBot in a weekend
- Free for 3 unpaid invoices
- Pro ($7/mo) = unlimited + auto-reminders
- Already tracking $50k in invoices

4/ How it works: [GIF demo]

5/ Try it free: [link]

First 50 users get 50% off Pro forever ($3.50/month)

RT if you've ever lost track of who owes you! 💸
